## Clean Code:
* Follows PEP-8 guidelines
* Purposeful, modular functions
* Clear function/variable names

## Good Documentation:
* Clean, clear readme and repo organization
* Effective use of markdown cells and clear explanation of thought process

## Proper Data Science:
* Thorough investigation of irregularities in cleaning 
* Clean visualizations, perhaps a few too many colors for clarity
* Awesome recommendation system! This is above and beyond and really adds value to the results

## Comments:
* Great job, this hits all the bases and then some. It's cleanly executed top to bottom 
* A couple visuals felt a bit cluttered
* The optimization comparisons probably could have utilized functions for easier experimentation
